### **What is Cloud Computing?**  
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### **Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing**  
1. **On-Demand Self-Service**  
   - Users can access computing resources as needed without manual intervention from service providers.  
   - Example: Provisioning virtual machines in seconds.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   - Resources are available over the internet and accessible from a wide range of devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and tablets.

3. **Resource Pooling**  
   - Resources are pooled to serve multiple users using a multi-tenant model, dynamically assigned based on demand.

4. **Scalability and Elasticity**  
   - Scale up or down resources as your needs change (e.g., adding more storage or servers during a sale event).

5. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**  
   - You only pay for what you use, reducing costs associated with purchasing and maintaining hardware.

### **Types of Cloud Computing**  
1. **Public Cloud**  
   - Owned and operated by third-party providers (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).  
   - Offers services over the internet to multiple customers.

2. **Private Cloud**  
   - Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a provider.  
   - Offers more control and customization.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**  
   - A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility and cost-efficiency.

### **Cloud Service Models**  
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
   - Provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage.  
   - Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
   - Provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without managing infrastructure.  
   - Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.

3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
   - Delivers software applications over the internet.  
   - Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Zoom.
